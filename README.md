# Berry Yield Prediction

Welcome to the Berry Yield Prediction repository! In this project, we aim to predict berry yield using a dataset generated by the Wild Blueberry Pollination Simulation Model. This open-source, spatially-explicit simulation program enables exploration of factors impacting pollination efficiency and yield in the wild blueberry agroecosystem. The dataset and simulation model have been validated using field observations and experimental data collected over the past 30 years in Maine, USA, and the Canadian Maritimes.

## Dataset Overview

- **Bumbles (bees/m²/min)**: Density of bumblebees in the field.
- **Andrena (bees/m²/min)**: Density of Andrena bees in the field.
- **Osmia (bees/m²/min)**: Density of Osmia bees in the field.
- **MaxOfUpperTRange (°C)**: Highest recorded upper band daily air temperature during the bloom season.
- **MinOfUpperTRange (°C)**: Lowest recorded upper band daily air temperature.
- **AverageOfUpperTRange (°C)**: Average upper band daily air temperature.
- **MaxOfLowerTRange (°C)**: Highest recorded lower band daily air temperature.
- **MinOfLowerTRange (°C)**: Lowest recorded lower band daily air temperature.
- **AverageOfLowerTRange (°C)**: Average lower band daily air temperature.
- **RainingDays (Day)**: Total number of days during the bloom season with precipitation greater than zero.
- **AverageRainingDays (Day)**: Average number of raining days during the entire bloom season.

## Contribution Guidelines
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or provide feedback. Let's collaborate to enhance the predictive power of our model and gain deeper insights into berry yield prediction.

Happy coding! 🍇🌿
